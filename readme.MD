# Requirements

I will try to use some PoC's here in order to onboard myself to kotlin.

- Rest API implementation, integration testing with mockMvc
- Data layer with MongoDb, integration testing with test containers
- Producers and consumers with Kafka, integration testing with test containers
- Transactional Event listeners
- Routing implementation on Kafka, to handle different type of events on same topic
- Some DDD implementation on a very basic domain
- Kafka Streams (did not start)
- Converting some transactional event listeners to event sourcing pattern(did not start)
- Some functional programming requirements (Ongoing)
